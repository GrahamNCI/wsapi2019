      <li> First as a developer relearning how to code in open source, background is in programming languages like Fortran, C, Access, embedded SQL with Pascal on Vax miniframes.</li> <br>
      <li> So sharing this example as "working progress", personal project to develop my coding skills, and sharing with you on You Tube so I can connect to other developers in the same situation.</li> <br>
      <li> So this code is not production code, is not object orientated, its just my best guess at getting working an idea I have and hopefully by doing so going to learn a better way of coding open source and improve my development skills.</li><br>
      <li> Also hope by sharing this work that i'll connect with other coders like yourself, that we can learn from each other and build better applications</li>
